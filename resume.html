<p>Somewhere I&#39;m consistently challenged and growing as a developer/person.
Somewhere with great people, exciting projects (whether it be technologically
or conceptually). Somewhere that cares about the community and gives back.
Flexibility and lifestyle are important as well.</p>
<h2 id="me">ME</h2>
<p>Professional autodidactic software engineer with over 10 years of experience.
Very interested in the intersections of computer science, art, and
community. Believes there is no &quot;one true way&quot; and thinks that we all have a
lot to learn from each other, so perhaps we should all be a bit nicer.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Rhino 2019 - 2021
Senior DevOps Engineer | New York, NY</p>
<p>Security Deposit replacement startup. First senior engineering hire
(employee #25). Mentored many more junior developers and helped grow
the engineering team out to about 100 people (including contractors).
Year one was largely working on application feature development and
scaling/performance optimization/refactoring. Year two I moved over
to the fledgling DevOps team to officially focus on infrastracture.
while our team was vastly under resourced (2 people supporting 80 engineers),
we managed to ship a ton of projects including setting up the company to
migrate off of Heroku to AWS using SRE/DevOps best practices such as IAC
(terraform), immutable infrastracture (docker), CI/CD, etc. Prepared internal
workshops for introducing the developer and data teams to these tools and
concepts in both AWS and GCP. List of random technologies used:
ruby/typescript/elixir/python/bash/rust/aws/gcp/etc</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lane Honey 2018
Senior Developer | New York, NY</p>
<p>Trucking Logistics startup. Responsibilities included gathering
software requirements from founder and implementing them in both greenfield
and legacy systems. Most systems were written in Haskell, though newer ones
were written in Clojure, Ruby, and Python. Successfully migrated off of a
very slow NixOS based build and deploy process to stack (Haskell build tool)
and Docker/Kubernetes on AWS. Built load pricing calculator and load pricing
options platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Projector (Orphid, Ic) 2015 - 2017

large swathes of backend realtime dataprocessing infrastracture as well as
devops/productionalization [docker/nix/terraform/aws/gcp/etc] of said
services. Helped develop website and mobile sdks [cljc, ruby, swift, obj-c,
